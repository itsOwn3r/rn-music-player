# Local Server Player

In this version, When selecting a song to be played, a request will be sent to an api (make sure to search and replace for `http://192.168.1.1` and replace it with your own IP or domain), and the song will be played on the server! (backend code provided in `nextjs-backend` folder).

Changing the song's position, volume and play/pause are also in sync with the server! Enjoy!
